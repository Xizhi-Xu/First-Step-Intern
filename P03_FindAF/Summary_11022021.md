# Summary for 11-02-2021 meeting

## In today's meeting, we discussed:

* the difference between population allele freqeuncy (AF) vs. cohort based AF:
    * Population AF gives more information on the patterns for the variants on global scale or race/ethinicities level.
    * Cohort based allele freqeuency give information on the disease or question the researchers are asking.
    * Some additional interesting reading on AF:
        * [Obesity-associated SNPs and AF](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-4262-9)
        * [Discussion of Hardy-Weinberg equation](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/natural-selection/hardy-weinberg-equilibrium/v/hardy-weinberg)
        * [How 23 and me use allele freqeuncy to determine your ancestry](https://www.23andme.com/ancestry-composition-guide/)

* rare variant: population AF < 1% vs. common variant: population AF > 5%

* the structure for the bim file from raw data and how to search for the population level AF using the tools below.

* some useful tools to visualize and search for the AF for certain variants:
    * [gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/): Good online interactive tool. Please pay attention to the right version.
    * [annovar](https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/): Good database resrouce for precomupted AF. Please pay attention to version and data source.
    * [1000G calculator](http://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/AlleleFrequency?db=core): For history of 1000G project. Please refer to [1000G wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000_Genomes_Project). A good online tool to calculate the AF based on 1000G population.

## the plan for this week:

* Please continue to get youself familiar with the Plink software and explore the result from plink commands. Feel free to upload your results to the box or github folder.

* Please try to explore the online AF calculation tools above and find the best way to get the populational AF for the variants in the BIM file from the raw data. 
    * Tips: there are many variants in the BIM files so searching it one by one is not a good solution.
