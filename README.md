## Abstract
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involve testing genetic variants across the genomes of many individuals to identify genotypeâ€“phenotype associations. GWAS have revolutionized the field of complex disease genetics over the past decade, providing numerous compelling associations for human complex traits and diseases. Despite clear successes in identifying novel disease susceptibility genes and biological pathways and in translating these findings into clinical care, GWAS have not been without controversy. Prominent criticisms include concerns that GWAS will eventually implicate the entire genome in disease predisposition and that most association signals reflect variants and genes with no direct biological relevance to disease. In this Review, we comprehensively assess the benefits and limitations of GWAS in human populations and discuss the relevance of performing more GWAS.

## Thoughts
After reading the background information of GWAS, I feel very impressed and excited. I have learned some basic knowledge of genetics in high school, but I never knew GWAS has such incredible testing methods and enormous contribution to the science. It's my honor to learn it now and I will put my efforts in my future study.
